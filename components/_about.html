        <h3>Where We Came From</h3>
        <p>Radical Movers is a family owned company started in 2010. We began our journey with an idea, a company that was more about the client than the money. Where helping was more important than price. It sounded like a fantasy, business need money to run, but why not do both. We started out with one truck, some friends, and our client first mentality. We've had some bumps on the road but we've moved from one truck an a home "office" to soon to be three trucks, a proper office space for clients and hirees alike, and a reputation everyone here at Radical Movers is proud of.</p>
