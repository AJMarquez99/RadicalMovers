        <h3>Where We Came From</h3>
        <p>Radical Movers is a family owned company started in 2010. We began our journey with an idea, a company that was more about the client than the money. Where helping was more important than price. It sounded like a fantasy, business need money to run, but why not do both. We started out with one truck, some friends, and our client first mentality. We've had some bumps on the road but we've moved from one truck an a home "office" to soon to be three trucks, a proper office space for clients and hirees alike, and a reputation everyone here at Radical Movers is proud of.</p>

        <h3>Where We Are Going</h3>
        <p>Radical Movers has undergone quite a bit of growth but we are expecting to continue expanding our reach further and further out, hopefully reaching our next goal of owning five trucks and aiding in the moving of residents along the entire Northeastern coast. Our goals seem like dreams right now but at a time, the company itself was but a dream. We are always looking for new, and promising movers to help our team grow.
